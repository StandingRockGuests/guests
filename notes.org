   Now that you have everything installed, run jake build inside the

* TODO connect with NYC stands with standing rock
The NYC Stands for Standing Rock committee is a group of Indigenous
scholars and activists, and settler/ PoC supporters. We belong and are
responsible to a range of Indigenous peoples and nations, including
Tlingit, Haudenosaunee, Secwepemc, St’at’imc, Creek (Muscogee),
Anishinaabe, Peoria, Diné, Maya Kaqchikel, and Quechua. We have joined
forces to support the Standing Rock Sioux in their continued assertion
of sovereignty over their traditional territories. We welcome the
support and participation of Indigenous peoples and allied
environmental/ community/ social justice organizations in the New York
area. If you can offer your organization’s support, please email
NYCnoDAPL@gmail.com to let us know how you would like to be
involved. Connect with us on Twitter @NYCnoDAPL and our Facebook page
NYC Stands with Standing Rock.
