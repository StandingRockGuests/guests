(("This war did not spring up on our land, this war was brought upon
      us by the children of the Great Father who came to take our land
      without a price, and who, in our land, do a great many evil
      things... This war has come from robbery - from the stealing of
      our land."

 ("We told them that the supernatural powers, Táku Wakȟáŋ, had given to the Lakȟóta, the
buffalo for food and clothing. We told them that where the buffalo ranged, that was
our country. We told them that the country of the buffalo was the country of the
Lakȟóta. We told them that the buffalo must have their country and the Lakȟóta must
have the buffalo."
